# Basic Sales Summary with SQLite and Python
Overview

This project demonstrates how to use SQLite, Python, and simple data visualization tools to analyze sales data. It shows how to create a small database, run SQL queries from Python, and plot results using matplotlib.

You will learn how to:

Set up a SQLite database to store sales records.

Write SQL queries inside Python to get summary statistics.

Use pandas to load SQL query results into a DataFrame.

Display data with print statements.

Create a simple bar chart to visualize total revenue by product.

Save the chart as an image file.

# Files Included

sales_data.db: The SQLite database file that contains a table called sales with product sales data.

sales_summary.py: Python script that connects to the database, runs queries, prints results, and plots a bar chart.

sample_sales_data.csv: A CSV file with sample sales data that can be imported into the database.

sales_chart.png: A bar chart image generated by the Python script showing revenue by product.

# Sample Sales Data
| Product | Quantity | Price per Unit |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Apple   | 10       | \$0.50         |
| Banana  | 20       | \$0.30         |
| Orange  | 15       | \$0.40         |
| Apple   | 5        | \$0.50         |
| Banana  | 10       | \$0.30         |
| Orange  | 10       | \$0.40         |

# What You Will See

When you run the script, it prints a table like this:

  product  total_qty  revenue
0   Apple         15      7.5
1  Banana         30      9.0
2  Orange         25     10.0


Then a bar chart appears showing revenue for each product, and the image file sales_chart.png is saved.

# Why This Is Useful

This simple project can be a starting point for:

Learning how to use SQL databases in Python.

Understanding basic data analysis and visualization.

Building small reporting tools.

Practicing Python scripting with real data.
